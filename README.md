# 🧩 Assembly End Game

A simple interactive **Assembly End Game** built to demonstrate core programming logic, state management, and conditional rendering. The game challenges the player to guess characters correctly before running out of attempts, with visual feedback based on game progress.

This project focuses on **logic, clarity, and learning**, rather than complex UI or advanced frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Assembly End Game is inspired by classic word‑guessing games. The player attempts to reveal a hidden word by making guesses. Each incorrect guess brings the game closer to an end state, while correct guesses move the player toward victory.

The game ends when:

* The player **successfully guesses the full word** (Win 🎉)
* The player **runs out of allowed attempts** (Game Over ❌)

---

## ✨ Features

* Random word selection
* Letter‑by‑letter guessing
* Win and loss detection
* Dynamic game status messages
* Visual feedback for game states (won, lost, farewell)
* Clean and readable code structure

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **TypeScript** – for type safety and clarity
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – core game logic
* **React** (if applicable) – UI rendering and state management
* **CSS** – styling and visual feedback

## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. A random word is selected at the start of the game.
2. The player makes guesses one at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
5. The game continuously checks for win or loss conditions.
6. A final message is displayed when the game ends.



## 📌 Learning Objectives

This project was built to:

* Strengthen understanding of **conditional logic**
